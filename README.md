A Web Application with Neo4J's Knowledge Database on World's unsolved mystyeries.

> DISCLAIMER: Mysteries are Mysteries for a reason, it is not a fact and 

This is a personal project for me to learn Neo4J and graph database's features. As my skills are focused on frontend and web development, I want to turn this project into a learning opportunity to familiarise with the latest graph database technologies

## 1. Project Development Plan

I target to complete development of this project and continuously polish the CSS's and beauty features of this web application after completing major features.

### 1.1 Phase 1 (MVP)

1. A Knowledge database with 10 mysteries pre-inserted manually to Neo4J's database with Schema defined (for detailed schema, refer to Section 2. Database Schema (MVP))

1. Fast API Setup under `api/` that caters with Neo4J's CRUD operations

1. A working NextJS Web application that connects with the database remotely, and visualises each nodes

1. User can read, view thumbnail of related images, and navigate to related youtube videos for deeper learning of the event

## 2. Database Schema (MVP)

### Mystery Node
### Person
### Location
### Time Period
